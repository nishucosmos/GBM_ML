#Predicting Survival in Glioblastoma Patients
Internship: BioCogniz | May–July 2025
Focus: Using data-driven approaches to support better care outcomes in brain cancer

🌍 Why This Project Matters


Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive brain cancers, with most patients surviving only a year after diagnosis. Predicting who might live longer or shorter can guide treatment decisions, clinical priorities, and patient care planning.


During this internship, I explored whether clinical and genomic data could be used to build models that help stratify survival outcomes for GBM patients.

🔎 What I Did

    Collected and prepared patient data (clinical details, mutations, hypoxia scores, ancestry factors) from the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas.

    Explored patterns in the data: how mutation load, chromosomal instability, or ancestry might relate to survival.

    Built and compared different prediction models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic, Boosting methods).

    Tested how reliable these models were across different validation settings.

📊 Key Findings

    Some genomic and ancestry features strongly influenced survival outcomes.

    Certain models, like Random Tree and LogitBoost, predicted survival with very high accuracy (~97–99%).

    The models were especially good at identifying high-risk patients, which is clinically important.

💡 Takeaway


This work showed how data science can complement clinical judgment. While no model replaces doctors, such tools can:

    Highlight patients at higher risk,

    Reveal hidden patterns in genomic data,

    Support the move toward precision oncology.
